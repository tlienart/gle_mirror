GLE (Graphics Layout Engine) is a graphics scripting language designed for creating publication quality figures (e.g., a chart, plot, graph, or diagram). GLE supports various chart types (including function plot, histogram, bar chart, scatter plot, contour plot, color map, and surface plot) through a simple but flexible set of graphing commands. More complex output can be created by relying on GLE's scripting language, which is full featured with subroutines, variables, and logic control. GLE relies on LaTeX for text output and supports mathematical formulea in graphs and figures. GLE's output formats include EPS, PS, PDF, JPEG, and PNG.
