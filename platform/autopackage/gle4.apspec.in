[Description]
GLE (Graphics Layout Engine) is a high-quality graphics package for scientists, combining a 
user-friendly scripting language with a full range of facilities for producing 
publication-quality graphs, diagrams, posters and slides. GLE provides LaTeX quality fonts 
together with a flexible graphics module which allows the user to specify any feature of a 
graph. Complex pictures can be drawn with user-defined subroutines and simple looping 
structures. Current output formats include EPS, PS, PDF, JPEG, and PNG.
